## Competitive Advantage
HKInfoHub stands out by offering a natural, conversational interface to access Hong Kong information services, presenting complex data through beautiful, custom-designed visual components rather than plain text responses. Unlike traditional information apps that require navigating multiple screens and menus, HKInfoHub allows users to simply ask for what they need and receive visually rich, actionable information instantly. 

Below is a comprehensive, phase‐1 task breakdown for HKInfoHub. We begin by laying out the overall chat interface structure and core UI, then implement the essential API integrations and visual response components. Each task includes a clear user story, user flow description, UI/state details, and data needs. Note that while the overall roadmap includes many additional features (MTR, ferry, news, etc.), this breakdown covers Phase 1: core chat interface with weather, air quality, and limited KMB bus tracking functionality. Future phases will add the remaining services.
